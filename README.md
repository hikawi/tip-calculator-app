## My process

### Built with

- **As** semantic **as** possible HTML5 markup
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)

### What I learned

This was my first app built with so much interactivity, and Vue made it so much simpler than plain JavaScript. Had some hickups with the `v-model` directive, but I got it working in the end.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue getting more comfortable with Vue and Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Vue - Component v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html)
